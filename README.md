## Task 02: EDA on a Dataset of Choice

**📄 Description**

  For my second task, I was assigned to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset of my choice. I selected the **Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024** dataset from Kaggle. This dataset presents a comprehensive compilation of the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2024.
  It provides extensive insights into each track's attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms, offering a valuable resource for music analysts, enthusiasts, and industry professionals. The dataset includes information such as track name, 
  artist, release date, ISRC, streaming statistics, and presence on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and more.
